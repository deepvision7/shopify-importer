&lt;p&gt;
	Medical Tattooing is fast becoming the must have answer post surgery for a wealth of conditions where visual improvement or long tern skin re-colouration is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fantastic results can be achieved for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Areola pigmentation and LD/tram scar flattening&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scar and burn relaxation by MCA techniques and skin camouflage colouration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skin rejuvenation using targeted needle plates and rejuvenating serums&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skin graft and vitiligo pigmentation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scalp camouflage including MPB&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Facial feature restoration for eyebrows (full or partial), eye socket definition, restoration of the lip vermillion and lip infill techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(pics) Stephen says: “the treatment has been a definite success. I can see and feel noticeable improvements in the appearance of my skin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(pics) Tammi says: “after my accident I endured a great deal of painful surgery to minimise my scarring which healed red, raised and bumpy. After having medical tattooing treatments my scars are now barely visible. The procedures were very quick to heal leaving softer, flatter scars and some re-pigmentation.”&lt;/p&gt;

	A true taupe eyebrow colour with brown undertones. This colour is a great performer which can be used alone on moderately cool skin undertones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A good colour choice for Fitzpatrick I - III skin tone clients who have white, gray or salt and pepper scalp hair without the benefit of natural eyebrow hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Or, a client who has gray or salt and pepper natural eyebrow hair. This may be too dark of a background colour for clients who have a significant amount of white bushy natural eyebrow hair. Use appropriately. Taupe also works for blondes who want a medium taupe eyebrow. Best Taupe ever with long stretches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	between re-touches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When used on ruddy skin types &amp;nbsp;(reddish or pinkish appearance) consider adding Grey Vanish or 24 Carat Mod to prevent the colour from healing too cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lighten with Sahara or Lighten Up. Darken with Espresso, Eskimo Gray or the Charcoal pigment listed in the CIC Eyeliner Colours section. If a warmer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	pigment is desired, consider a warmer colour. Note: Less brown undertones will be evident on the ruddier (reddish and pinkish) skin types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The result will appear grayer. Favourite Combinations: Blends well with Hazelnut, Cappuccino, Sahara, Brève and Crème Latte. An endless range of blondes may be created when Taupe is blended with Sahara&lt;/p&gt;
